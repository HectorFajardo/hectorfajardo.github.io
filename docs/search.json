    "text": "Hi there! üëã\nI‚Äôm an agricultural engineer and agronomist with a passion for keeping nutrients where they belong ‚Äî in the soil, not the water.\nI‚Äôm currently pursuing my PhD at North Carolina State University (Go Pack! üê∫üêæ) in Biological and Agricultural Engineering, where I spend my days thinking about phosphorus, modeling watersheds, and explaining to my computer why it should cooperate.\nAlso, I‚Äôm proud to be both a STEPS Scholar and a FFAR Fellow, which basically means I get to work with some brilliant people while trying to save the world one nutrient cycle at a time.\nBefore landing in Raleigh, NC, I earned my Master‚Äôs in Soil Fertility from Louisiana State University (Geaux Tigers! üêÖ) and my Bachelor‚Äôs in Agricultural Engineering from Universidad Mayor de San Andr√©s in Bolivia ‚õ∞Ô∏èüáßüá¥.\nIn short ‚Äî I love soil, sustainability, and simulations. If it involves plants, water, or code, there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôm interested."
