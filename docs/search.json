NDVI measurements from both platforms were strongly correlated, with further improvements achieved by adjusting for growing-degree–related variables. GreenSeeker NDVI more effectively explained variation in biomass and nitrogen content, though both sensors exhibited saturation at high biomass levels. Strong linear relationships were observed for key macronutrients (N, K, P) and micronutrients (Mn, Cu), while others showed weaker correlations. Overall, the findings demonstrate that NDVI-based remote sensing is a promising and practical approach for estimating cover crop biomass and nutrient uptake.\n\n\nProject 2: Impact of planting method and rate of cover crops on soil nutrient levels and on sugarcane yield and quality components\nIn this project, planting method and seeding rate of cool-season cover crops were evaluated to on their influence on soil nutrient dynamics, as well as sugarcane yield and quality, across five Louisiana sites and two crop ages. Eight combinations of broadcast or drilled planting and varying seeding rates were tested using a legume–brassica cover crop mix, with measurements collected for cane yield, quality components, and soil macronutrients. Neither planting method nor seeding rate significantly affected sugarcane yield, quality parameters, cover crop nutrient removal, or soil nutrient concentrations, which varied mainly due to site conditions and sugarcane uptake. Although immediate effects on yield and soil nutrients were minimal, the study indicates that winter cover crops establish well in newly planted cane and may contribute more substantially to long-term nutrient management benefits in subsequent ratoon cycles."
