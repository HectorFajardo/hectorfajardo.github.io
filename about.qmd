**Hi there!** 👋\
I'm an agricultural engineer and agronomist with a passion for keeping nutrients where they belong --- in the soil, not the water.

I'm currently pursuing my PhD at **North Carolina State University** (Go Pack! 🐺🐾) in [**Biological and Agricultural Engineering**](https://bae.ncsu.edu/), where I spend my days thinking about phosphorus, modeling watersheds, and explaining to my computer why it *should* cooperate.

Also, I'm proud to be both a [**STEPS Scholar**](https://steps-center.org/steps-team/hector-fajardo/) and a [**FFAR Fellow**](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/aec215c0f5ed4c5684a6235ce385f9c3), which basically means I get to work with some brilliant people while trying to save the world one nutrient cycle at a time.

Before landing in Raleigh, NC, I earned my *Master's in Soil Fertility* from *Louisiana State University* (Geaux Tigers! 🐅) and my *Bachelor's in Agricultural Engineering* from *Universidad Mayor de San Andrés* in Bolivia ⛰️🇧🇴.

In short --- I love soil, sustainability, and simulations. If it involves plants, water, or code, there's a good chance I'm interested.
